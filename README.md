# python_NN_source_code_practice

## Description:
This is a source code practice to dig into the neural network model estimation process.
- initialize from a Matlab neural network fit module
- sample data from image pixels
- fit a neural network model for accurate image recognition

## What's Covered:
- Forward Propogation on cost function evaluatoin
- Built in two types of activation functions (tanh, sigmoid)
- Backpropogation on gradient derivation
- Tried different learning rate method (constant, decayed, scheduled, cycling, RMSProp)
- Tried batch gradient descent algorithm

## What's to be added next:
- Try Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms (SGD, mini-batch SGD)
- Try more adaptive learning rate methods (momentum, AdaGrad, Adam, others)

## Future investigations:
- Regression problem
- Density Approximation problem
