# python_NN_source_code_practice

## Description:
This is a source code practice to dig into the neural network model estimation process.
- initialize from a Matlab neural network fit module
- sample data from image pixels
- fit a neural network model for accurate image recognition

## 5.18 initial version coverage
- Forward Propogation on cost function estimation
- Built in two types of activation functions (tanh, sigmoid)
- Backpropogation on gradient derivation
- Tested different learning rate method (constant, decayed, scheduled, cycling, RMSProp)
- Tested batch gradient descent algorithm

## 7.11 coverage:
- Tested Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms (SGD, mini-batch SGD)
- Tested more adaptive learning rate methods (momentum, AdaGrad, Adam, others)

## Future investigations:
- Regression problem
- Density Approximation problem
